    "# **What makes a horror story scary?: A linguistic analysis of short horror stories.**\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many ideas and theories as to what makes a horror story successful in building tension, and eventually creating the feeling of dread and fear one expects from the horror genre. Whether it's the use of **emotive language**, **foreboding imagery** or other elements which leave the reader uneasy about their own surroundings. In my essay I will analyse the methods used to evoke such feelings from the reader in ten short horror stories found on the internet . In my investigation, I wanted to check whether words which are considered as *typically horror-related*, will in fact appear in a collection of horror stories as the most frequent words.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The first aspect which I wanted to investigate were the **words** considered as the most chilling, and whether they appeared in my chosen text. According to a collection of words from a website called **[thoughtcatalog.com](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fthoughtcatalog.com%2Fjeremy-london%2F2018%2F09%2Fscary-words%2F%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR0w9-MhjvYV8udbW7FESDrYG3uz4jgo0asgMsQwWpvsdFO4WHdepM2QEO0&h=AT0te5H3d9DGhc8_akVvL2Qbj3ZS6dM6QmO9bsbdF__BOqOAq-JO0p8TYht3ERkIBNcCd_A0LRF5_Q1-7Wr59TyLXczto8hFUy7SuDbxXK2ZplmQ7Pdgd2wxK_DDwJRCWYmk2Q)**, some of the most teriffying words are:\n",
    "1. Abominable\n",
    "2. Agonizing\n",
    "3. Beastly \n",

    "6. Crawly\n",
    "7. Daunting\n",
    "8. Eeerie\n",
    "9. Ghastly\n",
    "10. Menacing \n",

    "For this essay I first scraped a collection of short horror stories from the website Project Gutenberg. The collection I chose was titled *\"Twenty Five Ghost Stories\"* by W.Bob Holland.\n"

      "and to the club<span class=\"pagenum\"><a name=\"page_250\" id=\"page_250\"></a>{250}</span> whose colors he wore. And he had every expectation of\r\n",
      "making a good showing to-day. Yet a reflection of the weird conditions\r\n",
      "which had brought about the present contest took away some of his\r\n",
      "self-possession when a few minutes later he was marched over to the\r\n",

      "Washington came up to him again, when the preparations were completed,\r\n",
      "to shake his hand and whisper a word or two of encouragement in his ear.\r\n",

      "contemptuously and said something of a sarcastic nature partly under his\r\n",
      "breath when the two lined up, side by side, for the start. To these\r\n",
      "slights Reilly paid no heed; he had a strong belief that when the race\r\n",
      "was over there would be left in the mutton-like head of his opponent\r\n",
      "very little of his present inclination toward the humorous. The\r\n",
      "soldierâs mount<span class=\"pagenum\"><a name=\"page_251\" id=\"page_251\"></a>{251}</span> was a handsome black mare, fourteen and a half hands\r\n",
      "high; strong of limbs and at the flanks, and animated by a spirit that\r\n",
      "kept her prancing around with continuous action. It must be admitted\r\n",
      "that the man rode very well. He guided the animal with ease and\r\n",
      "nonchalance when she reared and plunged, and kept her movements confined\r\n",
      "to an incredibly small piece of ground, considering her abundance of\r\n",
      "action.</p>\r\n",

      "<p>âKeep to your own side of the road throughout the race. I donât want to\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "<p>To this Harry replied in some derision, âIâll give you a good share of\r\n",

      "then the officer who held the pistol fired the first shot.</p>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<p>Reilly was well satisfied with the conditions under which the race was\r\n",
      "to be made. The road was wide and level, smooth, hard and straight, and\r\n",
      "a strong breeze which had sprung up, blew squarely against his back. His\r\n",
      "wheel was geared up to eighty-four inches; the breeze promised to be a\r\n",
      "valuable adjunct in pushing it along. Awaiting the second and last\r\n",
      "signal, Reilly glanced down the two blue ranks of soldiers, which\r\n",
      "stretched away into hazy lines in the distance and converged at the\r\n",
      "termination of the course where a flag had been stuck into the ground.\r\n",
      "The soldiers were at parade rest. Their unceasing<span class=\"pagenum\"><a name=\"page_252\" id=\"page_252\"></a>{252}</span> movements as they\r\n",
      "chatted to one another, turning their bodies this way and that and\r\n",
      "craning their heads forward to look toward the starting point, and then\r\n",
      "jerking them back, made the lines seem like long, squirming snakes. At\r\n",
      "the end of the course a thick bunch of militiamen clogged the road and\r\n",
      "overspread into the fields.</p>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<p>Crack! The signal to be off. Reilly shoved aside the fellow who had been\r\n",
      "holding his wheel upright while astride of it, and pushed down on the\r\n",
      "pedals. The mareâs hoofs dug the earth; her great muscular legs\r\n",
      "straightened out; she sprang forward with a snort of apparent pleasure,\r\n",
      "taking the lead at the very start. Reilly heard the shout of excitement\r\n",
      "run along the two ranks of soldiers. He saw them waving their arms and\r\n",
      "hats as he went by. And on ahead through the cloud of dust there was\r\n",
      "visible the shadow-like outlines of the snorting, galloping horse, whose\r\n",
      "hoof beats sounded clear and sharp above the din which came from the\r\n",
      "sides of the highway. The mare crept farther and farther ahead. Very\r\n",
      "soon a hundred feet or more of the road lay between her and the\r\n",
      "bicyclist. Harry turned in his saddle and called out another sarcasm.</p>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<p>âI shall pass you very soon. Keep to your own side of the road!â Reilly\r\n",
      "shouted, not a bit daunted by the way the race had commenced. His head\r\n",
      "was well down over the handle-bars, his back had the shape of the upper\r\n",
      "portion of an immense egg. Up and down his legs moved; faster and<span class=\"pagenum\"><a name=\"page_253\" id=\"page_253\"></a>{253}</span>\r\n",
      "faster and faster yet. He went by the soldiers so rapidly that they only\r\n",
      "appeared to be two streaks of blurry color. Their sharp rasping shouts\r\n",
      "sounded like the cracking of musketry. The cloud of dust blew against\r\n",
      "the bicyclistâs head and into his mouth and throat. When he glanced\r\n",
      "ahead again he saw with satisfaction that the mare was no longer\r\n",
      "increasing her lead. It soon became evident even that he was slowly\r\n",
      "cutting down the advantages she had secured.</p>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<p>Harry again turned his head shortly afterward, doubtless expecting to\r\n",
      "find his opponent hopelessly distanced by this time. Instead of this\r\n",
      "Reilly was alarmingly close upon him. The man ejaculated a sudden oath\r\n",
      "and lashed his animal furiously. Straining every nerve and sinew the\r\n",
      "mare for the moment pushed further ahead. Then her pace slackened a bit\r\n",
      "and Reilly again crept up to her. Closer and closer to her than before,\r\n",
      "until his head was abreast of her outstretched tail. Harry was lashing\r\n",
      "the mare and swearing at her unceasingly now. But she had spurted once\r\n",
      "and appeared to be incapable of again increasing her speed. In this way\r\n",
      "they went on for some little distance, Harry using his whip brutally,\r\n",
      "the mare desperately struggling to attain a greater pace, Reilly hanging\r\n",
      "on with tenacity to her hind flanks and giving up not an inch of ground.</p>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<p>A mile is indeed a very short distance when traversed at such a pace.\r\n",
      "The finishing flag was<span class=\"pagenum\"><a name=\"page_254\" id=\"page_254\"></a>{254}</span> already but a few hundred feet further on.\r\n",
      "Reilly realized that it was time now to go to the front. He gritted his\r\n",
      "teeth together with determination and bent his head down even further\r\n",
      "toward his front wheel. Then his feet began to move so quickly that\r\n",
      "there was only visible an indistinct blur at the sides of his crank\r\n",
      "shaft. At this very second, with a face marked with rage and hatred,\r\n",
      "Harry brought his horse suddenly across the road to thet part of it\r\n",
      "which he had been warned to avoid.</p>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<p>It is hard to tell what kept Reilly from being run into and trampled\r\n",
      "under foot. An attempt at back pedaling, a sudden twist of the\r\n",
      "handle-bar, a lurch to one side that almost threw him from his seat.\r\n",
      "Then, in the fraction of a second he was over on the other side of the\r\n",
      "road, pushing ahead of the mare almost as though she were standing\r\n",
      "still. The outburst of alarm from the throats of the soldiers changed\r\n",
      "when they saw that Reilly had not been injured; first into a shout of\r\n",
      "indignation at the dastardly attempt which had been made to run him\r\n",
      "down, and then into a roar of delight when the bicyclist breasted the\r\n",
      "flag a winner of the race by twenty feet.</p>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<p>As he crossed the line Reilly caught a glimpse of Washington. He stood\r\n",
      "close to the flag and was waving his hat in the air with the enthusiasm\r\n",
      "of a schoolboy. Reilly went on down the road slackening his speed as\r\n",
      "effectively as he could. But before it was possible to entirely stop\r\n",
      "his<span class=\"pagenum\"><a name=\"page_255\" id=\"page_255\"></a>{255}</span> wheelâs momentum the noisy acclamations in his rear ceased with\r\n",
      "startling suddenness. He turned in his saddle and looked back. As sure\r\n",
      "as St. Peter he had the road entirely to himself. There wasnât a soldier\r\n",
      "or the ghost of a soldier in sight.</p>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<p>As soon as he could he turned his bicycle about and rode slowly back\r\n",
      "along the highway, now so singularly deserted, looking hither and\r\n",
      "thither in vain for some trace of the vanished army. Even the flag which\r\n",
      "had been stuck into the ground at the end of the one-mile race course\r\n",
      "was gone. The breeze had died out again and the air was tranquil and\r\n",
      "warm. In the branches of a nearby tree two sparrows chirped and\r\n",
      "twittered peacefully. Reilly went back to the place where the camp had\r\n",
      "been. He found there only open fields on one side of the road and a\r\n",
      "clump of woodland on the other. He continued on down the little hill up\r\n",
      "which Harry and his companions had brought him a few hours previously\r\n",
      "and followed the road on further, coming finally to the fork in it near\r\n",
      "which was located the old farmhouse wherein he had been taken captive.\r\n",
      "The house was, as it had been when he had previously entered it, falling\r\n",
      "apart from age and neglect. When he went inside he found lying on the\r\n",

      "\n",
      "This collection of ghost stories owes its publication to an interest\n",
      "that I have long felt in the supernatural and in works of the\n",
      "imagination. As a child I was deeply concerned in tales of spooks,\n",
      "haunted houses, wraiths and specters and stories of weird experiences,\n",
      "clanking chains, ghostly sights and gruesome sounds always held me\n",
      "spellbound and breathless.\n",
      "\n",
      "Experiences in editorial offices taught me that I was not alone in\n",
      "liking stories of mystery. The desire to know something of that\n",
      "existence that is veiled by Death is equally potent in old age and in\n",
      "youth, and men, women and children like to be thrilled and to have a\n",
      "âcreepyâ feeling along the spinal column as the result of reading of a\n",
      "visitor from beyond the grave.\n",
      "\n",
      "This volume contains the most famous of the weird stories of Edgar Allan\n",
      "Poe, that master of this form of literature. âThe Black Catâ contains\n",
      "all the needed element of mystery and supernatural, and yet the feline\n",
      "acts in a natural manner all of the time, and the story is quite\n",
      "possibly true. It is only in the manner of its{6} telling that the tale\n",
      "becomes one that fittingly finds its place in this collection.\n",
      "\n",
      "Guy de Maupassant, the clever Frenchman, is also represented by two\n",
      "effective bits of work, and other less widely known writers have also\n",
      "contributed stories that are worth reading, and when once read will be\n",
      "remembered. There is not a story among the twenty-five that is not\n",
      "worthy of close reading.\n",
      "\n",
      "There has recently been a revival in interest in ghost stories. Many of\n",
      "the high-class magazines have within a few months printed stories with\n",
      "supernatural incidents, and writers whose names are known to all who\n",
      "read have turned their attention to this form of literature.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whether or not the reader believe in ghosts, he cannot fail to be\n",
      "interested in this little book. Without venturing to express a positive\n",
      "opinion either way, I will only say with Hamlet: âThere are more things\n",
      "in heaven and earth, Horatio, than are dreamt of in your philosophy.â\n",

      "THE BLACK CAT.\n",
      "BY EDGAR ALLAN POE.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the most wild, yet most homely narrative which I am about to pen, I\n",
      "neither expect nor solicit belief. Mad indeed would I be to expect it,\n",
      "in a case where my very senses reject their own evidence. Yet, mad am I\n",
      "not—and very surely do I not dream. But to-morrow I die, and to-day I\n",
      "would unburden my soul. My immediate purpose is to place before the\n",
      "world, plainly, succinctly and without comment a series of mere\n",
      "household events. In their consequences, these events have\n",
      "terrified—have tortured—have destroyed me. Yet I will not attempt to\n",
      "expound them. To me they have presented little but horror, to many they\n",
      "will seem less terrible than baroques. Hereafter, perhaps, some\n",
      "intellect may be found which will reduce my phantasm to the\n",
      "commonplace—some intellect more{8} calm, more logical, and far less\n",
      "excitable than my own, which will perceive in the circumstances I detail\n",
      "with awe nothing more than an ordinary succession of very natural causes\n",
      "and effects.\n",
      "\n",
      "From my infancy I was noted for the docility and humanity of my\n",
      "disposition. My tenderness of heart was even so conspicuous as to make\n",
      "me the jest of my companions. I was especially fond of animals, and was\n",
      "indulged by my parents with a great variety of pets. With these I spent\n",
      "most of my time, and never was so happy as when feeding and caressing\n",
      "them. This peculiarity of character grew with my growth, and in my\n",
      "manhood I derived from it one of my principal sources of pleasure. To\n",
      "those who have cherished an affection for a faithful and sagacious dog,\n",
      "I need hardly be at the trouble of explaining the nature or the\n",
      "intensity of the gratification thus derivable. There is something in the\n",
      "unselfish and self-sacrificing love of a brute, which goes directly to\n",
      "the heart of him who has had frequent occasion to test the paltry\n",
      "friendship and gossamer fidelity of mere Man.\n",
      "\n",
      "I married early, and was happy to find in my wife a disposition not\n",
      "uncongenial with my own. Observing my partiality for domestic pets she\n",
      "lost no opportunity of procuring those of the most agreeable kind. We\n",
      "had birds, goldfish, a fine dog, rabbits, a small monkey and a cat.{9}\n",
      "\n",
      "This latter was a remarkably large and beautiful animal, entirely black,\n",
      "and sagacious to an astonishing degree. In speaking of his intelligence,\n",
      "my wife, who at heart was not a little tinctured with superstition, made\n",
      "frequent allusion to the ancient popular notion, which regarded all\n",
      "black cats as witches in disguise. Not that she was ever serious upon\n",
      "this point—and I mention the matter at all for no better reason than\n",
      "that it happens, just now, to be remembered.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pluto—this was the catâs name—was my favorite pet and playmate. I\n",
      "alone fed him, and he attended me wherever I went about the house. It\n",
      "was even with difficulty that I could prevent him from following me\n",
      "through the streets.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our friendship lasted, in this manner, for several years, during which\n",
      "my general temperament and character—through the instrumentality of the\n",
      "fiend Intemperance—had (I blush to confess it) experienced a radical\n",
      "alteration for the worse. I grew, day by day, more moody, more\n",
      "irritable, more regardless of the feelings of others. I suffered myself\n",
      "to use intemperate language to my wife. At length I even offered her\n",
      "personal violence. My pets, of course, were made to feel the change in\n",
      "my disposition. I not only neglected them, but ill-used them. For Pluto,\n",
      "however, I still retained sufficient regard to restrain me from\n",
      "maltreating him, as I made no scruple of maltreating the rabbits, the\n",
      "monkey{10} or even the dog, when by accident or through affection they came\n",
      "in my way. But my disease grew upon me—for what disease is like\n",
      "alcohol! And at length even Pluto, who was now becoming old, and\n",
      "consequently somewhat peevish—even Pluto began to experience the\n",
      "effects of my ill-temper.\n",
      "\n",
      "One night, returning home much intoxicated from one of my haunts about\n",
      "town, I fancied that the cat avoided my presence. I seized him, when, in\n",
      "his fright at my violence, he inflicted a slight wound upon my hand with\n",
      "his teeth. The fury of a demon instantly possessed me. I knew myself no\n",
      "longer. My original soul seemed, at once, to take its flight from my\n",
      "body; and a more than fiendish malevolence, gin-nurtured, thrilled every\n",
      "fiber of my frame. I took from my waistcoat pocket a penknife, opened\n",
      "it, grasped the poor beast by the throat, and deliberately cut one of\n",
      "its eyes from the socket! I blush, I burn, I shudder while I pen the\n",
      "damnable atrocity.\n",
      "\n",
      "When reason returned with the morning—when I had slept off the fumes of\n",
      "the nightâs debauch—I experienced a sentiment half of horror, half of\n",
      "remorse, for the crime of which I had been guilty; but it was, at best,\n",
      "a feeble and equivocal feeling, and the soul remained untouched. I again\n",
      "plunged into excess, and soon drowned in wine all memory of the deed.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the meantime the cat slowly recovered.{11}\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "âOne night, returning home much intoxicated.â\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "{12}\n",
      "\n",
      "The socket of the lost eye presented, it is true, a frightful\n",
      "appearance, but he no longer appeared to suffer any pain. He went about\n",
      "the house as usual, but, as might be expected, fled in extreme terror at\n",
      "my approach. I had so much of my old heart left as to be at first\n",
      "grieved by this evident dislike on the part of a creature which had once\n",
      "so loved me. But this feeling soon gave place to irritation. And then\n",
      "came, as if to my final and irrevocable overthrow, the spirit of\n",
      "perverseness. Of this spirit philosophy takes no account. Yet I am not\n",
      "more sure that my soul lives than I am that perverseness is one of the\n",
      "primitive impulses of the human heart—one of the indivisible primary\n",
      "faculties or sentiments which give direction to the character of man.\n",
      "Who has not, hundreds of times, found himself committing a vile or silly\n",
      "action, for no other reason than because he knows he should not? Have we\n",
      "not a perpetual inclination, in the teeth of our best judgment, to\n",
      "violate that which is Law, merely because we understand it to be such?\n",
      "This spirit of perverseness, I say, came to my final overthrow. It was\n",
      "this unfathomable longing of the soul to vex itself—to offer violence\n",
      "to its own nature—to do wrong for the wrongâs sake only—that urged me\n",
      "to continue and finally to consummate the injury I had inflicted upon\n",
      "the unoffending brute. One morning, in cold blood, I slipped a noose\n",
      "about its neck, and hung it to{13} the limb of a tree; hung it with the\n",
      "tears streaming from my eyes and the bitterest remorse at my heart; hung\n",
      "it because I knew that it had loved me, and because I felt it had given\n",
      "me no offense; hung it because I knew that in so doing I was committing\n",
      "a sin—a deadly sin that would so jeopardize my immortal soul as to\n",
      "place it, if such a thing were possible—even beyond the reach of the\n",
      "infinite mercy of the most merciful and most terrible God.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the night of the day on which this cruel deed was done, I was aroused\n",
      "from sleep by the cry of âfire!â The curtains of my bed were in flames.\n",
      "The whole house was blazing. It was with great difficulty that my wife,\n",
      "a servant and myself made our escape from the conflagration. The\n",
      "destruction was complete. My entire worldly wealth was swallowed up, and\n",
      "I resigned myself thenceforward to despair.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am above the weakness of seeking to establish a sequence of cause and\n",
      "effect between the disaster and the atrocity. But I am detailing a chain\n",
      "of facts, and wish not to leave even a possible link imperfect. On the\n",
      "day succeeding the fire I visited the ruins. The walls, with one\n",
      "exception, had fallen in. This exception was found in a compartment\n",
      "wall, not very thick, which stood about the middle of the house, and\n",
      "against which had rested the head of my bed. The plastering had here, in\n",
      "great measure, resisted the{14} action of the fire—a fact which I\n",
      "attributed to its having been recently spread. About this wall a dense\n",
      "crowd were collected, and many persons seemed to be examining a\n",
      "particular portion of it with very minute and eager attention. The words\n",
      "âstrange!â âsingular!â and other similar expressions excited my\n",
      "curiosity. I approached and saw, as if graven in bas-relief upon the\n",
      "white surface, the figure of a gigantic cat. The impression was given\n",
      "with an accuracy truly marvelous. There was a rope about the animalâs\n",
      "neck.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I first beheld this apparition—for I could scarcely regard it as\n",
      "less—my wonder and my terror were extreme. But at length reflection\n",
      "came to my aid. The cat, I remembered, had been hung in a garden\n",
      "adjacent to the house. Upon the alarm of fire this garden had been\n",
      "immediately filled by the crowd—by some one of whom the animal must\n",
      "have been cut from the tree and thrown through an open window into my\n",
      "chamber. This had probably been done with the view of arousing me from\n",
      "sleep. The falling of other walls had compressed the victim of my\n",
      "cruelty into the substance of the freshly spread plaster, the lime of\n",
      "which with the flames, and the ammonia from the carcass, had then\n",
      "accomplished the portraiture as I saw it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although I thus readily accounted to my reason, if not altogether to my\n",
      "conscience, for the{15}\n",

      "{16}\n",
      "\n",
      "startling fact just detailed, it did not the less fail to make a deep\n",
      "impression upon my fancy. For months I could not rid myself of the\n",
      "phantasm of the cat; and, during this period, there came back into my\n",
      "spirit a half sentiment that seemed, but was not, remorse. I went so far\n",
      "as to regret the loss of the animal, and to look about me, among the\n",
      "vile haunts which I now habitually frequented, for another pet of the\n",
      "same species and of somewhat similar appearance, with which to supply\n",
      "its place.\n",
      "\n",
      "One night as I sat, half stupefied, in a den of more than infamy, my\n",

      "station, and that when they had found him he was going to the house for\n",
      "help. But they had laughed at his story and had flung him into the tiny,\n",
      "stifling calaboose of the town.\n",
      "\n",
      "What were their proofs? Walter Stedman, a young fellow of about\n",
      "twenty-six, had come from the city to their quiet town, just when times\n",
      "were at their hardest, in search of work. The most of the men living in\n",
      "the town were honest fellows, doing their work faithfully, when they\n",
      "could get it, and when they had socially asked Stedman to have a drink\n",
      "with them, he had refused in rather a scornful manner. âThat infernal\n",
      "city chap,â he was called, and their hate and envy increased in strength\n",
      "when Albert Kelsey had employed him in preference to any of themselves.\n",

      "had gone afloat, with the added{39} information that his employerâs\n",
      "daughter had repulsed him, saying that she would not marry a common\n",
      "laborer. So Stedman, when this news reached his employerâs ears, was\n",
      "discharged, and this, then, was his revenge! For them, these proofs were\n",
      "sufficient to pronounce him guilty.\n",

      "grew hopeless in the knowledge that no one would believe his story, and\n",
      "that his undeserved punishment would be swift and sure, a tramp,\n",
      "boarding a freight car several miles from the town, sped away from the\n",

      "From the tiny window of his prison Walter Stedman could see the red glow\n",

      "his life was soon to set, a life that had been innocent of all crime,\n",
      "and that now was to be ended for a deed that he had never committed.\n",
      "Most prominent of all the visions that swept through his mind was that\n",
      "of Margaret Kelsey, lying as he had first found her, fresh from the\n",

      "of an afternoon meeting between the two{40} in the woods of the Kelsey\n",
      "estate—how, just as they were parting, Walter had heard footsteps near\n",
      "them, and, glancing sharply around, saw an evil, scowling, murderous\n",

      "they had believed that the young man had formally proposed and had been\n",

      "thieves in England, and had enjoyed such a famous career that his name\n",
      "was a household{63} word. At that moment there was an additional interest\n",
      "attached to him. He had been convicted of burglary at the Northminster\n",
      "assizes in 1871, and sentenced to ten yearsâ penal servitude. After\n",
      "serving nearly two years of his time he had escaped from Portland,\n",
      "getting away in such clever fashion that he had never been heard of\n",

      "again.\n",

      "animals about the place. Thereâs some very valyable plate there. Thatâs\n",

      "about 1 a. m., then heâll pass through the back and front kitchens and\n",
      "into the butlerâs pantry—only itâs a butleress, âcos there ainât no men\n",
      "at all—and there heâll set to work on the safe. Some of his late pals\n",

      "\n",
      "Mrs. Marriner looked at me with an expression betokening the most\n",

      "was not there. I looked under my bed, and of course he was not there. He\n",
      "must have gone downstairs. But then the women must have seen him. There\n",
      "was only one door to the house. I gave it up in despair and began to\n",
      "smoke my pipe. By the time I had drawn the last whiff I decided that if\n",
      "anyone was âintoxicated,â it was probably Mrs. Marriner and Mrs.\n",
      "Higgins, and that my strange visitor had departed by the door. I was not\n",
      "going to believe that he had anything supernatural about him.\n",
      "\n",
      "I had no duty that night, and as the hours wore on I found myself stern\n",
      "in my resolve to go{66} up to Miss Singletonâs house and see what I could\n",
      "make out of my informantâs story. It was my opinion that my late visitor\n",
      "was a whilom âpalâ of Light Toed Jim, and that having become aware of\n",
      "the latterâs plot, he had, for some reason of his own, decided to split\n",
      "on his old chum. Thievesâ disagreement is an honest manâs opportunity,\n",
      "and I determined to solve the truth of the story told me. Lest it should\n",
      "come to nothing, I decided not to report the matter to my chief. If I\n",
      "could really capture Light Toed Jim, my success would be all the more\n",
      "brilliant by being suddenly sprung upon the authorities.\n",
      "\n",
      "I made my plan of action rapidly. I took a revolver with me and went up\n",
      "to Miss Singletonâs house. Fortunately, I knew the housekeeper there—a\n",
      "middle-aged, strong-minded woman, not easily frightened, which was a\n",
      "good thing. To her I communicated such information as I considered\n",
      "necessary. She consented to conceal me in the room where the safe stood.\n",
      "There was a cupboard close by the safe from which I could command a full\n",
      "view of the burglarâs operations and pounce upon him at the right\n",
      "moment. If only my information was to be relied upon, there was every\n",
      "chance of my capturing the famous burglar.\n",
      "\n",
      "Soon after midnight, when the house was all quiet, I went to the pantry\n",
      "and got into the cupboard, locking myself in. There were two openings{67}\n",
      "in the panel, through either of which I was able to command a full view\n",
      "of the room. My position was somewhat cramped, but the time soon passed\n",
      "away. My mind was principally occupied in wondering if I was really\n",
      "about to have a chance of distinguishing myself. Somehow, there was an\n",
      "air of unreality about the events of the evening which puzzled me.\n",
      "\n",
      "Suddenly I heard a sound which put me on the alert at once. It was\n",
      "nothing more than the creaking of a board or opening of a door would\n",
      "make in a quiet house; but it sounded intensified to my expectant ears.\n",
      "I drew myself up against the door of the cupboard and placed my eye to\n",
      "the opening in the panel. I had oiled the key of the door, and kept my\n",
      "fingers upon it in readiness to spring upon the burglar at the proper\n",
      "moment. After what seemed some time I saw the gleam of light through the\n",
      "keyhole of the door opening into the pantry. Then it opened, and a man\n",
      "carrying a small lantern came gently into the room. At first I could see\n",
      "nothing of his face; but when my eyes grew accustomed to the hazy light\n",
      "I saw that I had been rightly informed, and that the burglar was indeed\n",
      "no other than the famous Light Toed Jim.\n",
      "\n",
      "As I stood there watching him I could not help admiring the cool fashion\n",
      "in which he went to work. He went over to the window and examined it. He\n",
      "tried the door of the cupboard{68} in which I stood concealed. Then he\n",
      "locked the door of the pantry and turned his attention to the safe. He\n",
      "set his lamp on a chair before the lock and took from his pocket as neat\n",
      "and pretty a collection of tools as ever I saw. With these he went\n",
      "quietly and swiftly to work.\n",
      "\n",
      "Light Toed Jim was a somewhat slimly built fellow, with little muscular\n",
      "development about him, while I am a big man with plenty of bone and\n",
      "sinew. If matters had come to a fight between us I could have done what\n",
      "I pleased with him; but I knew that Jim would not chance a fight.\n",
      "Somewhere about him I felt sure there was a revolver, which he would use\n",
      "on the least provocation. My plan, therefore, was to wait until his back\n",
      "was bent over the lock of the safe, then to open the cupboard door\n",
      "noiselessly and fall bodily upon him, pinning him to the ground beneath\n",
      "me.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before long the moment came. He was working steadily away at the lock,\n",
      "his whole attention concentrated on the job. The slight noise of his\n",
      "drill was sufficient to drown the faint click of the key in the cupboard\n",
      "door. I turned it quickly and tumbled right upon him, driving the tool\n",
      "out of his hands and tumbling him into a heap at the foot of the safe.\n",
      "He uttered an exclamation of rage and astonishment as he went down, and\n",
      "immediately began to wriggle under me like an eel. As I kept him down\n",
      "with one hand I tried to pull{69} out the handcuffs with the other. This\n",
      "somewhat embarrassed me, and the burglar profited by it to pull out a\n",
      "sharp knife. He had worked himself round on his back, and before I\n",
      "realized what he was after he was hacking furiously at me with his keen,\n",
      "dagger-like blade. Then I realized that we were going to have a fight\n",
      "for it, and prepared myself. He tried to run the knife into my side. I\n",
      "warded it off, but the blade caught the fleshy part of my left arm and I\n",
      "felt a warm stream of blood spurt out.\n",
      "\n",
      "That maddened me, and I seized one of the steel drills lying near at\n",
      "hand, and hit my man such a blow over the temple that he collapsed at\n",
      "once, and lay as if dead. I put the handcuffs on him instantly, and, to\n",
      "make matters still more certain, I secured his ankles. Then I rose and\n",
      "looked at my arm. The knife had made a nasty gash, and the blood was\n",
      "flowing freely, but it was not serious; and when the housekeeper, who\n",
      "had just then appeared on the scene, had bandaged it, I went out and\n",
      "secured the help of the first policeman I met in conveying Light Toed\n",
      "Jim to the office.\n",
      "\n",
      "I felt a proud man when I made my report to the inspector.\n",
      "\n",
      "âLight Toed Jim?â said he. âWhat, James Bland? Nonsense, Parker.â But I\n",
      "took him to the cells where Jim was being attended to by the doctor.{70}\n",
      "\n",
      "âYouâre right, Parker,â he said. âThatâs the man. Well, this will be a\n",
      "fine thing for you.â\n",
      "\n",
      "After a time, feeling a little exhausted, I went home to try and get\n",
      "some sleep. The surgeon had attended to my arm, and told me it was but a\n",
      "superficial wound. It felt sore enough in spite of that.\n",
      "\n",
      "I had no sooner reached my lodgings than I saw sitting in my easy-chair\n",
      "the strange man who had called upon me earlier in the evening. He rose\n",
      "to his feet when I entered. I stared at him in utter astonishment.\n",
      "\n",
      "âWell, guvânor,â said he, âI see youâve done it. Youâve got him square\n",
      "and fair, I reckon?â\n",
      "\n",
      "âYes,â I said.\n",
      "\n",
      "âAh!â he said, with a sigh of complete satisfaction. âThen Iâm\n",
      "satisfied. Yes, I donât know as how thereâs aught more I could say. I\n",
      "reckon as how Light Toed Jim anâ me is quits.â\n",
      "\n",
      "I was determined to find out who this man was this time. âSit down,â I\n",
      "said. âThereâs a question or two I must ask you. Just let me get my coat\n",
      "off and Iâll talk to you.â I took my coat off and went over to the bed\n",
      "to lay it down. âNow then,â I began, and looked around at him. I said no\n",
      "more, being literally struck dumb. The man was gone!\n",
      "\n",
      "I began to feel uncomfortable. I ran hastily downstairs, only to find\n",
      "the outer door locked and bolted, as I had left it a few minutes\n",
      "before.{71} I went back, utterly nonplussed. For an hour I pondered the\n",
      "matter over, but could neither make head nor tail of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I went down to the office next morning I was informed that the\n",
      "burglar wanted to see me. I went to his cell, where he was lying in bed\n",
      "with his head bandaged. I had hit him pretty hard, as it turned out, and\n",
      "it was probable he would have to lie on the sick list for some days.\n",
      "âWell, guvânor,â said he, âyouâd the best of me last night. You hit me\n",
      "rather hard that time.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âI was sorry to have to do it, my man,â I answered. âYou would have\n",
      "stabbed me if you could.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âYes,â he said, âI should. But I say, guvânor, come a bit closer; I want\n",
      "to ask you a question. How did you know I was on that little job last\n",
      "night? For, sâelp me, there wasnât a soul knew a breath about it but\n",
      "myself. I hadnât no pals, never talked to anybody about it, never\n",
      "thought aloud about it, as I knows on. How came you to spot it,\n",
      "guvânor?â\n",
      "\n",
      "There was no one else in the cell with us, and I thought I might find\n",
      "out something about my mysterious visitor of the night before. âIt was a\n",
      "pal of yours who gave me the information,â I said.\n",
      "\n",
      "âCanât be, guvânor. No use telling me that. I ainât got no\n",
      "pals—leastways not in this job.â{72}\n",
      "\n",
      "âDid you ever know a man like this?â I described my visitor. As I\n",
      "proceeded, Light Toed Jimâs face assumed an expression of real terror.\n",
      "Whatever color there was in it faded away. I never saw a man look more\n",
      "thoroughly frightened. âYes, yes,â he said, eagerly. âIn course I know\n",
      "who it is. Why, itâs Barksea Bill, as I palâd with at one time—and what\n",
      "did he say, guvânor—that he owed me a grudge? That we was quits at\n",
      "last? Right you are, âcos he did owe me a grudge. I treated Bill very\n",
      "shabby—very shabby, indeed, and he swore solemn heâd have his revenge.\n",
      "Onây, guvânor, what you see wasnât Barksea Bill at all, but his ghost,\n",
      "âcos Barksea Billâs been dead and buried this three year.â\n",
      "\n",
      "I was naturally very much exercised in my mind over this weird\n",
      "development of the affair, and I used to think about it long after Light\n",
      "Toed Jim had once more retired to the seclusion of Portland. While he\n",
      "was in charge at Westford I tried more than once to worm some more\n",
      "information out of him about the defunct Barksea Bill, but with no\n",
      "success. He would say no more than that âBill was dead and buried this\n",
      "three year;â and with that I had to be content. Gradually I came to have\n",
      "a firm belief that I had indeed been visited by Barksea Billâs ghost,\n",
      "and I often told the story to brother officers, and sometimes got well\n",
      "laughed at. That, however, mattered little to me; I felt sure that any\n",
      "man{73} who had gone through the same experience would have had the same\n",
      "beliefs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course I got my promotion and was soon afterward married. Things went\n",
      "well with me, and I was lifted from one step to another. In my secret\n",
      "mind I was always sure I owed my first rise to the burglarâs ghost, and\n",
      "I should have continued to think so but for an incident which occurred\n",
      "just five years after my capture of Light Toed Jim.\n",
      "\n",
      "I had occasion to travel to Sheffield from Westford, and had to change\n",
      "trains at Leeds. The carriage I stepped into was occupied by a solitary\n",
      "individual, who turned his face to me as I sat down. Though dressed in\n",
      "more respectable fashion, I immediately recognized the man who had\n",
      "visited me so mysteriously at my lodgings. My first feeling was one of\n",
      "fear, and I daresay my face showed it, for the man laughed.\n",
      "\n",
      "âHallo, guvânor,â said he; âI see you knew me as soon as you come in.\n",

      "ainât a good un! Why, easy enough, guvânor. I was a-lodging for a day or\n",
      "two in the same house. Itâs easy enough, when{74} you know how, to open a\n",
      "door very quiet and to slip out, too.â\n",

      "come up to the attics, and there youâd haâ found me. So you took me for\n",
      "a ghost? Well, Iâm blowed.â\n",

      "foot he wheeled aside{92} sharply to the window; he had a sick dread of\n",
      "looking through the small panes—why he could not have told.\n",
      "\n",
      "When at last he found courage to look he saw that there was a small\n",
      "round table set just under the window—a work-table to all appearance;\n",
      "one of those things with lots of little compartments all round and a lid\n",
      "in the middle which shut over a well-like cavity for holding pieces of\n",
      "needlework. He remembered that his mother had one—thirty years before.\n",
      "\n",
      "Round the edge of the table was gripped a small, delicate hand. Gilbert\n",
      "Dentâs eyes ran from this bloodless hand and slim wrist to a shoulder\n",
      "under a coarse stuff bodice—to a rather wasted throat, which was bare\n",
      "and flung back.\n",
      "\n",
      "So this was the end—before the beginning. He saw her. She was dead;\n",
      "twisted on the floor with a ghastly face turned up toward the ceiling,\n",
      "and stiff fingers caught in desperation round the work table.\n",
      "\n",
      "He stumbled away along the path and into the lane.\n",
      "\n",
      "For a long time he could not realize the horror of this thing. The\n",
      "influence of the decayed house hung over him—nothing seemed real. It\n",
      "was quite dark when he moved away from the gate, and went in the\n",
      "direction of the nearest police station. That she was dead—this woman\n",
      "whose very name he did not know although she{93} influenced him so\n",
      "powerfully—he was certain; one look at the face would have told anyone\n",
      "that. That she was murdered he more than suspected. He had seen no blood\n",
      "about; there had been no mark on the long, bare throat, and yet the word\n",
      "rushed in his ears, âMurder.â\n",
      "\n",
      "Later on he went back with a police officer.\n",
      "\n",
      "They broke into the house and entered the room. It was in utter\n",
      "darkness, of course, by now. Dent, his fingers trembling, struck a\n",
      "match. It flared round the walls and lighted them for a moment before he\n",
      "let it fall on the dusty floor.\n",
      "\n",
      "The policeman began to light his lantern and turned it stolidly on the\n",
      "window. He had no reason for delay; he was eager to get to the bottom of\n",
      "the business. His professional zeal was whetted; this promised to be a\n",
      "mystery with a spice in it.\n",
      "\n",
      "He turned the light full on the window; he gave a strange, choked cry,\n",
      "half of rage, half of apprehension. Then he went up to Gilbert Dent, who\n",
      "stood in the middle of the room with his hands before his eyes, and took\n",
      "his shoulder and shook it none too gently.\n",
      "\n",
      "âThere ainât nobody,â he said.\n",
      "\n",

      "work-table. The woman was gone.\n",
      "\n",
      "They searched the house; they minutely inspected the garden. Everything\n",
      "was normal;{94} everything told the same mournful tale—of desertion, of\n",
      "death, of long empty years. But they found no woman, nor trace of one.\n",
      "\n",
      "âThis house,â said the policeman, looking suspiciously into the lawyerâs\n",
      "face, âhas been empty for longer than I can remember. Nobodyâll live in\n",
      "it. They do say something about foul play a good many years ago. I donât\n",

      "hands.â\n",
      "\n",
      "It was doubtful if Gilbert Dent heard one word of what the man was\n",
      "saying. He was too stunned to do anything but creep home—when he was\n",
      "allowed to go—and let himself stealthily into his own house with a\n",
      "latch key; he was afraid even of himself. He did not go to bed that\n",
      "night.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for the mystery of the woman, the matter was allowed to drop; it\n",
      "ended—officially. There was a shrug and a grin at the police station.\n",

      "\n",

      "and had some dinner, when Gilbert with a cry leapt forward to the very\n",
      "edge of the flat grass path on which they were strolling. The movement\n",
      "was so sudden that his brother barely{96} caught him in time. They\n",
      "struggled and swayed on the very edge of the cliff for a second;\n",
      "Gilbert, possessed by some sudden frenzy, seemed resolved to go over,\n",
      "but the other at last dragged him backward, and they rolled together on\n",
      "the close, thick turf.\n",
      "\n",
      "At this point Gilbert opened his eyes and tried to get on his feet.\n",
      "\n",
      "âBetter?â asked his brother, cheerfully, holding out a helping hand.\n",
      "âStrange! The sea has that effect on some people. Didnât think that you\n",

      "to try to account for anything. I have been inclined to think that you\n",
      "were right—that she, the woman at the window, was a fancy, that I had\n",
      "fallen in love with a creation of my own brain; but I saw her again\n",
      "to-night. You must have seen her yourself—she was within a couple of\n",
      "feet of you. Why did you not try and save her? It was nothing short of\n",

      "\n",
      "In the porch of the hotel he was met by a waiter on his return who told\n",

      "himself gone out.\n",
      "\n",
      "Directly he heard this he feared the worst; having, as is usual in such\n",

      "\n",
      "It was already getting dusk when he arrived there. He felt certain that\n",
      "Gilbert would go there. He got to the end of the lane and walked up it\n",
      "slowly, examining every house. There would be no difficulty in\n",
      "recognizing the one he wanted; Gilbert had described it in detail more\n",
      "than once.\n",
      "\n",
      "He stood outside the loosely hanging gate at last, and stared through\n",
      "the darkness at the shabby stucco front and rank garden.\n",
      "\n",
      "He went down a flight of steps to the back door, and finding it\n",
      "unfastened, stepped into a stone passage. It was one of the problems of\n",
      "the place that he should have avoided the main entrance door with a\n",
      "half-admitted dread, and that, only half admitting still, he was afraid\n",
      "to mount the long flight of stone stairs leading from the servantsâ\n",
      "quarters. However, he pulled himself together and went up to the room.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was quite dark inside. He heard something{98} scuttle across the floor;\n",
      "he felt the grit and dust of years under his feet. He struck a\n",
      "match—just as Gilbert had done—and looked first at the recess in which\n",
      "the window was built. The match flared round the room for a moment and\n",
      "gave him a flash picture of his surroundings. He saw the stripes of\n",
      "gaudy paper moving almost imperceptibly, like tentacles of some sea\n",
      "monster, from the wall; he saw a creature—it looked like a rat—scurry\n",
      "across the floor from the window to the great mantelpiece of hard white\n",
      "marble.\n",
      "\n",
      "If he had seen nothing more than this.\n",
      "\n",
      "He saw in detail all that the first match had flashed at him. He saw his\n",
      "brother lying on the floor; a ghastly coincidence, his hand was caught\n",
      "round the edge of the work-table as hers had been. The other hand was\n",
      "clenched across his breast; there was a look of great agony on his face.\n",
      "\n",
      "A dead face, of course. This was the end of the affair. He was lying\n",
      "dead by the window where the woman had sat every night at dusk and\n",
      "smiled at him.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second match went out; the brother of the dead man struck a third.\n",
      "He looked again and closely. Then he staggered to his feet and gave a\n",

      "the long, stone passages in the basement.{99}\n",
      "\n",
      "Gilbertâs head was thrown back; his chin peaked to the ceiling. On his\n",

      "faded; when the doctor saw his brother again in the full light and in\n",

      "companion of my youth, and I had been present at his wedding. His\n",
      "charming wife was full of goodness and grace. My friend wished to show\n",
      "me his happy home, and to introduce me to his two pretty little\n",
      "daughters. I was feted and taken great care of. Three days after my\n",
      "arrival I knew the entire city, curiosities, old castles, ruins, etc.\n",
      "Every day about four oâclock Albert would order the phaeton, and we\n",
      "would take a{101} long ride, returning home in the evening. One evening my\n",
      "friend said to me:\n",
      "\n",
      "âTo-morrow we will go further than usual. I want to take you to the\n",
      "Black Rocks. They are curious old Druidical stones, on a wild and\n",
      "desolate plain. They will interest you. My wife has not seen them yet,\n",
      "so we will take her.â\n",
      "\n",
      "The following day we drove out at the usual hour. Albertâs wife sat by\n",
      "his side. I occupied the back seat alone. The weather was gray and\n",
      "somber that afternoon, and the journey was not very pleasant. When we\n",
      "arrived at the Black Rocks the sun was setting. We got out of the\n",
      "phaeton, and Albert took care of the horses.\n",
      "\n",
      "We walked some little distance through the fields before reaching the\n",
      "giant remains of the old Druid religion. Albertâs wife wished to climb\n",
      "to the summit of the altar, and I assisted her. I can still see her\n",

      "The afternoon wind blew violently, and sighed through the stunted trees\n",
      "that grew around the stone cromlechs; not a dwelling nor a human being\n",
      "was in sight. We hastened to get down, and silently retraced our steps\n",
      "to the carriage.{102}\n",

      "We carefully wrapped the robes around his wife. She tied the veil around\n",
      "her face, and the horses started into a rapid trot. It was growing dark;\n",

      "and there and furze bushes formed the only vegetation. We began to feel\n",

      "phantom placed her fingers upon her lips to impose silence upon me. I\n",
      "could not utter a sound. The woman was clothed in white linen; her head\n",

      "As she turned I felt the same infernal pressure{103} on my shoulder, and the\n",

      "left—the road was deserted, not an object in sight.\n",
      "\n",
      "âWhat a dreadful gale!â said Madame Albert. âDid you feel it? I cannot\n",

      "an invisible hand; I am trembling still.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âNever mind,â said Albert, smiling; âwrap yourself up, my dear; we will\n",

      "\n",
      "A cold perspiration covered my forehead; a shiver ran through me; my\n",
      "tongue clove to the roof of my mouth, and I could not articulate a\n",
      "sound; a sharp pain in my shoulder was the only sensible evidence that I\n",
      "was not the victim of an hallucination. Putting my hand upon my aching\n",
      "shoulder, I felt a rent in the cloak that was wrapped around me. I\n",
      "looked at it; five perfectly distinct holes—visible traces of the grip\n",
      "of the horrible phantom. I thought for a moment that I should die or\n",
      "that my reason should leave me; it was, I think, the most dreadful\n",
      "moment of my life.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally I became more calm; this nameless agony had lasted for some\n",
      "minutes; I do not think it is possible for a human being to suffer more\n",
      "than I did during that time. As soon as I had recovered my senses, I\n",
      "thought at first I would tell my friends all that had passed, but{104}\n",
      "hesitated, and finally did not, fearing that my story would frighten\n",
      "Madame Albert, and feeling sure my friend would not believe me. The\n",
      "lights of the little city revived me, and gradually the oppression of\n",
      "terror that overwhelmed me became lighter.\n",
      "\n",
      "So soon as we reached home, Madame Albert untied her veil; it was\n",
      "literally in shreds. I hoped to find my clothes whole and prove to\n",
      "myself that it was all imagination. But no, the cloth was torn in five\n",
      "places, just where the fingers had seized my shoulder. There was no\n",

      "\n",
      "âIf we succeed in driving out the ghost, you will not raise the rent?â\n",
      "asked the boy, with a merry twinkle in his eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "âWell, no—not this year, at any rate,â laughed the agent. And so the\n",
      "house was rented; and the slip of a girl and the tall lad, her brother,\n",
      "went their way.{135}\n",
      "\n",
      "Within a week the family had moved into the house, and were delighted\n",
      "with it. It was large and cool, with wide halls and fine stairways, and\n",
      "with more room than they needed. But that did not matter in the least,\n",
      "for they had always been cramped in small houses, suffering many\n",
      "discomforts; and they never could have afforded such a place as this if\n",
      "it had not been âhaunted.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âBlessings on the ghost!â cried Margaret, gaily, as she ran about as\n",
      "merry as a child. âWho would be without a ghost in the house, when it\n",
      "brings one like this?â\n",
      "\n",
      "âAnd it is so near your school,â said the mother; âand I used to worry\n",
      "so over the long walk; and David can come home to lunch now, and you\n",
      "donât know what a pleasure that will be.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âIt seems to me,â David gravely explained, âthat if I should meet the\n",
      "ghost I would treat him with the greatest politeness and encourage him\n",
      "to stay. We shall not miss the room he takes, shall we? I think it would\n",
      "be well to set aside that room over yours, Maggie, for his ghostshipâs\n",
      "own, for we shall not need that, you know. Besides, the door doesnât\n",
      "shut, and he can go in and out without breaking the lock.â\n",
      "\n",
      "And then they all laughed and had a great deal of fun over the ghost,\n",
      "which was a great joke to them.\n",
      "\n",
      "They were very tired that night and slept soundly all night long. When\n",
      "they met the{136} next morning there was more laughter about the ghost which\n",
      "was shy about meeting strangers, probably, and had made no effort to\n",
      "introduce himself. For the next three days they were all hard at work,\n",
      "trying to bring chaos into something like order; and then it was time\n",
      "for the school to open, and Margaret was to begin teaching, and David\n",
      "inserted an advertisement in the city papers for a maid-of-all-work, who\n",
      "might help their mother in their absence.\n",
      "\n",
      "For one whole day prospective colored servants presented themselves and\n",
      "announced:\n",
      "\n",
      "âIs dis de house whar dey wants a worklady? No, maâam, I ainâ gwine to\n",
      "work in dis house. Ketch me workinâ in no haânted house.â\n",
      "\n",
      "After which they each and all departed, and others came in their stead.\n",
      "One was secured after a while, but no sooner had she talked across the\n",
      "fence with a neighborâs servant than she, too, departed.\n",
      "\n",
      "âNever mind, children,â said Mrs. Craig, wearily, âI would much rather\n",
      "do the work than be troubled in this way.â\n",
      "\n",
      "So the maid-of-all-work was dismissed and the Craig family locked the\n",
      "doors and went to their rooms, worn out with the dayâs anxieties.\n",
      "\n",
      "They had been in the house four days, and there had been neither sight\n",
      "nor sound of the ghost. The very mention of it was enough to start them\n",
      "all to laughing, for they were thoroughly{137} practical people, with a\n",
      "fondness for inquiring into anything that seemed mysterious to them and\n",
      "for understanding it thoroughly before they let it go.\n",
      "\n",
      "David was soon sleeping the sound sleep of healthy boyhood, and all was\n",
      "silent in the house, when Margaret stole softly into his room and laid\n",
      "her hand on his arm. He was not easy to waken, and several minutes had\n",
      "passed before he sat up in bed with an articulate murmur of surprise.\n",
      "\n",
      "âHush!â said Margaret, in a whisper, with her hand on his lips. âI want\n",
      "you to come into my room and listen to a sound that I have been hearing\n",
      "for some time.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âDoors creaking,â suggested David, as he began to dress.\n",
      "\n",
      "âNothing of the kind,â was all she said.\n",
      "\n",
      "They walked up the stairway, and along the upper hall to the door of the\n",
      "unused room. Something was wrong with the lock and the door would not\n",
      "stay fastened, as I have said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Something that was not fear thrilled their hearts as they pushed the\n",
      "door further ajar, and stood where they could see every foot of the\n",
      "vacant floor. One of their own boxes stood in the middle of the room,\n",
      "but aside from that, nothing was to be seen, and they looked at one\n",
      "another in silence.\n",
      "\n",
      "âHold the lamp a minute, Maggie,â David said, at last, and then he went\n",
      "all over the room, and{138} looked more particularly at its emptiness, and\n",
      "even felt the walls.\n",
      "\n",
      "âSecret panels, you know,â he said, with a smile, but it was a very\n",
      "puzzled smile indeed.\n",
      "\n",
      "âI canât see what it could have been,â Margaret said, as they went down\n",
      "the stairs.\n",
      "\n",
      "âNo, I canât see, either, but Iâm going to see,â said David. âThat was a\n",
      "chain, and chains donât drag around by themselves, you know. A ghost\n",
      "could not drag a chain, if he were to try.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âThe conventional ghost very often drags chains,â said Margaret, as she\n",
      "closed the door of her room.\n",
      "\n",
      "And then she lay awake all night and listened for the conventional ghost\n",
      "that dragged a chain, but it seemed that the weight of the chain must\n",
      "have wearied him, for he was not heard again.\n",
      "\n",
      "The mother had slept through it all, and next morning they gave her a\n",
      "vivid account of the nightâs adventure.\n",
      "\n",
      "âPerhaps it was someone in the house,â she said, in alarm. There were no\n",
      "ghosts within the bounds of possibility, so far as she was concerned,\n",
      "but burglars were very possible, indeed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Margaret and David both laughed more than ever.\n",
      "\n",
      "âWhat fun it would be,â said David, âfor a burglar to get into this\n",
      "house and try to find something worth carrying away!â{139}\n",
      "\n",
      "So they went on to the next night, all three fully determined to spend\n",
      "the night in listening for the ghost, and running him to earth if\n",
      "possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "But it was Margaret that heard the ghost, after all. She had been\n",
      "sleeping and was suddenly startled wide awake, and there, overhead, was\n",
      "the sound of the chain dragging; and just as she was on the point of\n",
      "springing out of bed to call her brother, the chain seemed to go out of\n",
      "the upper room. She lay still and listened, and in a moment she heard it\n",
      "again.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was coming down the stairs.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was no carpet on the stairs, and she could hear the chain drop\n",
      "from step to step, until it had come the whole way down. There it was,\n",
      "almost at the door of her room, and something that was strangely like\n",
      "fear kept her lying still, listening in horrified silence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then it went along the hall, dragging close to the door; and then\n",
      "further away; and back and forth for awhile; and then it began dragging\n",
      "back up the stairs again. Step by step she could hear it drawn over the\n",
      "edge of every step—and by the time it had reached the top she\n",
      "remembered herself and called David.\n",
      "\n",
      "Again did the brother and sister make a tour of the upper room, with the\n",
      "lamp. Not only that, but they looked into every nook and corner of the\n",
      "upper part of the house, and at last came{140} back, baffled. They had seen\n",
      "nothing extraordinary, and they had not heard a sound.\n",
      "\n",
      "âIâm going to see that ghost to-night,â David said to his sister the\n",
      "next evening.\n",
      "\n",
      "âHow?â\n",
      "\n",
      "âIâm going to sit up all night at the head of the stairs. Donât say\n",
      "anything about it to mother; it might make her uneasy.â\n",
      "\n",
      "So, after the household were all quiet, David slipped into his place at\n",
      "the head of the stairs, and sat down to his vigil. He had placed a\n",
      "screen at the head of the stairway so that it hid him from view—as if a\n",
      "ghost cared for a screen—and he established himself behind it, and\n",
      "prepared to be as patient as he could.\n",
      "\n",
      "It seemed to him that hours so long had never been devised as those the\n",
      "town clocks tolled off that night. He bore it until midnight moderately\n",
      "well, because, he argued with himself, if there were any ghosts about\n",
      "they would surely walk then; but they were not in a humor for walking;\n",
      "and still the hours rolled on without any developments. He took the\n",
      "fidgets, and had nervous twitches all over him, and at last he could\n",
      "endure it no longer, and had leaned his head back against the wall and\n",
      "was going blissfully to sleep when——\n",
      "\n",
      "He heard a chain dragging just beyond the open door of that unused room.\n",
      "\n",
      "In spite of himself a shiver ran down his back.{141} There was no mistaking\n",
      "it; it was a real chain, if he had ever heard one. More than that, it\n",
      "had left the room, and was coming straight towards the stairs. The hall\n",
      "was dark, and it was impossible for him to see anything, although he\n",
      "strained his eyes in the direction of the sound. And even while he\n",
      "looked it had passed behind the screen, and was going down the stairs,\n",
      "dropping from step to step with a clank.\n",
      "\n",
      "Half way down a narrow strip of moonlight from a stair-window lay\n",
      "directly across the steps. Whatever the thing was, it must pass through\n",
      "that patch of light, and David leaned forward and watched.\n",
      "\n",
      "Down it went from step to step, and presently it had slipped through the\n",
      "light, and was down; and a little later it came back again, through the\n",
      "light, and up the stairs, and back into that unused room.\n",
      "\n",
      "And then David slapped his knees jubilantly, and ran down to his room,\n",
      "and slept all the rest of the night.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next morning he was very mysterious about his discoveries of the night\n",
      "before.\n",
      "\n",
      "âOh, yes, I saw the ghost,â he said to Maggie. âThere; donât ask so many\n",
      "questions; Iâll tell you more about it to-morrow, maybe.â\n",
      "\n",
      "And that was all the information she could get from him. It was very\n",
      "provoking.\n",
      "\n",
      "That day David made a purchase down town{142} and brought home a bulky\n",
      "bundle, which he hid in his own room and would not let his sister even\n",
      "peep at.\n",
      "\n",
      "âIâm going to try to catch a ghost to-night,â he said, âand you know how\n",

      "\n",
      "He was working with something in the hall after the others had retired;\n",
      "but he did not sit up this time. He went to bed, and Margaret listened\n",
      "at his door and found that he was soon asleep.\n",
      "\n",
      "But away in the night they were all awakened by a squealing that brought\n",
      "them all into the hall in a great hurry; and there, at the head of the\n",
      "stairs, they found the huge rat-trap that David had set a few hours\n",
      "before, and in the midst of the toils was a rat.\n",
      "\n",
      "âWhy, David,â exclaimed the mother, âI didnât know that there was a rat\n",
      "in the house.â\n",
      "\n",
      "And then, all at once, she saw that there was a long chain hanging from\n",
      "a little iron collar around the creatureâs neck, and she and Margaret\n",
      "cried together.\n",
      "\n",
      "âAnd this was the ghost!â\n",
      "\n",
      "Such a funny ghost when they came to think of it—this poor rat, with a\n",
      "nest in some hole of the broken chimney. He had been someoneâs pet,\n",
      "once, perhaps; and now, the households he had broken up, the nights he\n",
      "had disturbed, the wild sensations he had created—it made his captors{143}\n",
      "laugh to think that this innocent creature had been the cause of the\n",
      "whole trouble.\n",
      "\n",
      "âIâll get a cage for him, and take care of him for the rest of his\n",
      "life,â said David. âWe owe him so much that we canât afford to be\n",
      "ungrateful.â\n",
      "\n",
      "The next morning he took the ghost-in-a-cage and showed it to the agent,\n",

      "\n",
      "âSo, you have a good house for about half price, all on account of that\n",
      "rat,â exclaimed the agent, grimly. âYoung man—but never mind, you\n",
      "deserve it. What are you working for now? Six dollars a week? If you\n",

      "strong-minded on the ghost subject, and early taught all of her children\n",
      "to be fearless mentally as well as physically, and, though dearly fond\n",
      "of hearing ghost stories, especially if they were real true ghosts, we\n",
      "were sadly skeptical as to their being anything of the kind that could\n",
      "harm. We were quite learned in ghostly lore, knew all about\n",
      "âdoppeigangers,â âWill oâ the Wisp,â âblue lights,â etc., and we could\n",

      "on her store of supernatural tales for our entertainment. The story I am\n",
      "about to relate she told us one stormy night, when, gathered round her\n",
      "chair in her own cozy sanctum, before a cheerful fire, we ate nuts and\n",
      "apples, and listened while she recited âan oâer true tale,â told her by\n",
      "her grandmother, who herself witnessed the vision:\n",

      "It was a fearful night, the wind sobbed and{145} wailed round the house like\n",
      "lost spirits mourning their doom; the rain beat upon the casements, and\n",
      "the trees, writhing in the torture of the fierce blast, groaned and\n",
      "swayed until their tops almost swept the earth; bright flashes of\n",
      "lightning pierced even through the closed shutters and heavy curtains,\n",
      "and the thunder had a sullen, threatening roar that made your blood\n",

      "curtains close, stir the fire and nestle deep in the arm-chair before\n",
      "it, with feet upon the fender, and have something cheerful to think or\n",

      "\n",
      "It was just such a night that Nancy Black died. âWhat a fearful night\n",
      "for the soul to leave its earthly home and go out into the vast, unknown\n",
      "future!â I spoke aloud, as, rousing from a train of thought, I drew my\n",
      "heavy mantle closer round me, wheeled my arm-chair nearer the fire, and\n",
      "cuddled down in it, burying my feet in the foot-cushion to warm them,\n",
      "for I felt strangely cold. I was in the library; it was my usual\n",
      "sitting-room, for I seldom used the parlors. What was the use? My books\n",
      "were my friends, and I loved best to be with them. My children dead, or\n",
      "married and away, the cold, grand parlors always{146} seemed gloomy and sad;\n",

      "It was a long, wide room across the hall from the parlors, running the\n",

      "ceiling. My husbandâs father had been a bibliomaniac, and my husband had\n",
      "had a leaning that way also, and the shelves held many an old rare work\n",
      "that was worth its weight in gold. The fire, though burning brightly,\n",
      "did not illume one-half the room of which, sitting in the chimney\n",
      "corner, I commanded a full view, and had been looking at the shadows\n",
      "playing on the furniture and shelves, as the flame shot up, and after\n",

      "appointed her; resting my head upon my hand, I sat gazing in the fire,\n",
      "thinking over her strange life, and still stranger death, and{147} wondering\n",

      "\n",
      "While sitting thus, a queer sensation crept over me; it was not fear,\n",

      "shiver, not like that of cold, ran from my head to my feet, and a\n",
      "sensation as though someone was breathing icy cold breath upon my\n",
      "forehead, the same feeling you would cause by holding a piece of ice to\n",
      "your cheek; it fluttered over my face and finally settled round my lips,\n",
      "as though the unseen one was caressing me, thrilling me with horror. But\n",
      "I am not fearful, nervous nor imaginative, and resolutely throwing off\n",
      "the dread that fell upon me, I turned round and looked up, and there, so\n",
      "close by my side that my hand, involuntarily thrown out, passed through\n",
      "her seeming form, stood Nancy Black. It was Nancy Black, and yet not\n",
      "Nancy Black; her whole body had a semi-transparent appearance, just as\n",
      "your hand looks when you hold it between yourself and a strong light;\n",

      "his own house in his socks and refuse to answer when spoken to. The only\n",

      "his hand, as I had noted particularly when he poured out my wine at\n",
      "dinner, was plump and soft, whereas the mysterious hand on the\n",
      "balustrade was thin and bony. And then, what was the real explanation of\n",
      "the face which had appeared to the two ladies? Indigestion might have\n",

      "soft step in the corridor outside, accompanied by a sound which was\n",
      "something between{162} a sigh and a groan. Very faint, but quite\n",
      "unmistakable, and, under the circumstances, discomposing. It might, of\n",

      "of sight so deeply were they set in their sockets. As his eye fell on\n",
      "the open chart a look of supreme joy fairly irradiated his features, and\n",

      "destroyed, and all hands had to take to the boats. Ten were in the boats\n",
      "at first, but their food had given out, and{235} one by one he had seen them\n",

      "\n",
      "Arriving, finally, at a place where the road forked off in two\n",
      "directions, Reilly was puzzled which way to go on. There happened to be\n",
      "a dwelling close by. Accordingly he dismounted, left his wheel leaning\n",
      "against a gate-post at the side of the road, and walked up a wretchedly\n",
      "flagged walk leading to the house, with the idea of getting instructions\n",

      "sashes and frames as well as the doors and door frames were missing from\n",
      "the openings in the side walls where once they had been, and that the\n",
      "entire side of the house, including that part of the stone foundation\n",
      "which showed above the ground, was full of cracks and seams. At first on\n",

      "from one side of the apartment and over in one corner was a large open\n",
      "fireplace, from the walls of which much of the brickwork had become\n",

      "vinegar cruet, which lay upon its side on the hearth of the fireplace,\n",
      "partly covered up by debris of loose bricks and mortar. He hastened back\n",
      "down the steps and crossed the room, taking the bottle up in his hand\n",
      "and examining it with curiosity. Being partly filled with a liquid of\n",
      "some kind or other the bottle was very soon uncorked and held under the\n",

      "and soapsuds. Over the tops of the tubs, partly filled with water, there\n",
      "were visible the edges of several well-soaked fabrics. Too add to his\n",
      "astonishment he noticed that in the chimney-place, which a moment before\n",
      "was falling apart, but now seemed to be clean and in good condition, a\n",
      "cheerful fire burned, and that above the flames was suspended an iron\n",
      "pot, from which issued a jet of steam. He noticed also that the entire\n",
      "appearance of the room had undergone a great change. Everything seemed\n",
      "to be in good repair, tidy and neat; the ceilings, the walls and the\n",
      "door; even the{240} stairway leading to the attic. The openings in the walls\n",
      "were fitted with window sashes and well-painted doors. The apartment\n",
      "had, in fact, evolved under his very eyesight from a state of absolute\n",
      "ruin into one of excellent preservation.\n",
      "\n",
      "All of this seemed so weird and uncanny, that Reilly stood for a moment\n",
      "or two in the transformed apartment, utterly dumbfounded, with his mouth\n",
      "wide open and his eyes all but popping out of his head. He was brought\n",
      "to his senses by the fellow who had shaken him growling out:\n",
      "\n",
      "âCome! Explain yourself!â\n",
      "\n",
      "âAn explanation is due me,â Reilly managed to gasp.\n",
      "\n",
      "âDonât bandy words with the rascal, Harry,â one of the other men spoke\n",
      "up. âBring him along to headquarters.â\n",
      "\n",
      "Thereupon, without further parley, the three men marched Reilly in\n",
      "military fashion into the open air and down to the road. Here he picked\n",
      "up at the gate-post his bicycle, while they unstacked a group of three\n",
      "old-fashioned-looking muskets located close by. When the young man had\n",
      "entered the house a few minutes before, this stack of arms had not been\n",
      "there. He could not understand it. Neither could he understand, on\n",
      "looking back at the building as he was marched off down the road, the\n",
      "mysterious agency that had transformed its dilapidated exterior, just as\n",
      "had been the interior, into a practically new condition.{241}\n",
      "\n",
      "While they trudged along, the strangers exhibited a singular interest in\n",
      "the wheel Reilly pushed at his side, running their coarse hands over the\n",
      "frame and handle-bar, and acting on the whole as though they never\n",
      "before had seen a bicycle. This in itself was another surprise. He had\n",
      "hardly supposed there were three men in the country so totally\n",
      "unacquainted with what is a most familiar piece of mechanism everywhere.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the same time that they were paying so much attention to the wheel,\n",
      "Reilly in turn was studying with great curiosity his singular-looking\n",
      "captors. Rough, unprepossessing appearing fellows they were, large of\n",
      "frame and unshaven, and, it must be added, dirty of face. What remained\n",
      "of their very ragged clothing, he had already noticed, was of a most\n",
      "remarkable cut and design, resembling closely the garments worn by the\n",
      "Continental militiamen in the War of Independence. The hats were broad,\n",
      "low of crown, and three-cornered in shape; the trousers were\n",
      "buff-colored and ended at the knees, and the long, blue spike-tailed\n",
      "coats were flapped over at the extremities of the tails, the flaps being\n",
      "fastened down with good-sized brass buttons. Leather leggings were\n",
      "strapped around cowhide boots, through the badly worn feet of which, in\n",
      "places where the leather had cracked open, the flesh, unprotected by\n",
      "stockings, could be seen. Dressed as he was, in a cleanly, gray cycling\n",
      "costume,{242} Reillyâs appearance, most assuredly, was strongly in contrast\n",
      "to that of his companions.\n",
      "\n",
      "After a brisk walk of twenty minutes, during which they occasionally met\n",
      "and passed by one or two or perhaps a group of men clothed and outfitted\n",
      "like Reillyâs escorts, the little party followed the road up a slight\n",
      "incline and around a well-wooded bend to the left, coming quite\n",
      "suddenly, and to the captive, very unexpectedly, to what was without\n",
      "doubt a military encampment; a village, in fact, composed of many rows\n",
      "of small log huts. Along the streets, between the buildings, muskets\n",
      "were stacked in hundreds of places. Over in one corner, on a slight\n",
      "eminence commanding the road up which they had come, and cleverly hidden\n",
      "from it behind trees and shrubbery, the young man noticed a battery of\n",
      "field pieces. Wherever the eye was turned on this singular scene were\n",
      "countless numbers of soldiers all garmented in three-cornered hats,\n",
      "spike-tailed coats and knee breeches, walking lazily hither and thither,\n",
      "grouped around crackling fires, or parading up and down the streets in\n",
      "platoons under the guidance of ragged but stern-looking officers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Harry stopped the little procession of four in front of one of the\n",
      "larger of the log houses. Then, while they stood there, the long blast\n",
      "from a bugle was heard, followed by the roll of drums. A minute or two\n",
      "afterward, several companies of militia marched up and grounded their\n",
      "arms,{243} forming three sides of a hollow square around them, the fourth\n",
      "and open side being toward the log house. Directly succeeding this\n",
      "maneuver there came through the doorway of the house and stepped up the\n",
      "center of the square, stopping directly in front of Reilly, a\n",
      "dignified-looking person, tall and straight and splendidly proportioned\n",
      "of figure, and having a face of great nobility and character.\n",
      "\n",
      "The cold chills chased one another down Reillyâs back. His limbs swayed\n",
      "and tottered beneath his weight. He had never experienced another such\n",
      "sensation of mingled astonishment and fright.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was in the presence of General Washington. Not a phantom Washington,\n",
      "either, but Washington in the flesh and blood; as material and earthly a\n",
      "being as ever crossed a personâs line of vision. Reilly, in his time,\n",
      "had seen so many portraits, marble busts and statues of the great\n",
      "commander that he could not be mistaken. Recovering the use of his\n",
      "faculties, which for the moment he seemed to have lost, Reilly did the\n",
      "very commonplace thing that others before him have done when placed\n",
      "unexpectedly in remarkable situations. He pinched himself to make sure\n",
      "that he was in reality wide awake and in the natural possession of his\n",
      "senses. He felt like pinching the figure in front of him also, but he\n",
      "could not muster up the courage to do that. He stood there trying to\n",
      "think it all out, and as his{244} thoughts became less stagnant, his fright\n",
      "dissolved under the process of reasoning his mind pursued. To reason a\n",
      "thing out, even though an explanation can only be obtained by leaving\n",
      "much of the subject unaccounted for, tends to make one bolder and less\n",
      "shaky in the knees.\n",
      "\n",
      "The series of strange incidents which he was experiencing had been\n",
      "inaugurated in the old-fashioned dwelling he had visited after\n",
      "information concerning the roads. And everything had been going along in\n",
      "a perfectly normal way up to, the very moment when he had taken a drink\n",
      "from the bottle found in the fireplace. But from that precise time\n",
      "everything had gone wrongly. Hence the inference that the drinking of\n",
      "the peculiar liquid was accountable in some way or other for his\n",
      "troubles. There was a supernatural agency in the whole thing. That much\n",
      "must be admitted. And whatever that agency was, and however it might be\n",
      "accounted for, it had taken Reilly back into a period of time more than\n",
      "a hundred years ago, and landed him, body and soul, within the lines of\n",
      "the patriot forces wintering at Valley Forge. He might have stood there,\n",
      "turning over and over in his mind, pinching himself and muttering, all\n",
      "the morning, had not the newcomer ceased a silent but curious inspection\n",
      "of his person, and asked: âWho are you, sir?â\n",
      "\n",
      "âJohn Reilly, at your pleasure,â the young man replied, adding a\n",
      "question on his own account: âAnd who are you, sir?â{245}\n",
      "\n",
      "Immediately he received a heavy thump on his back from Harryâs hard\n",
      "fist.\n",
      "\n",
      "âIt is not for you to question the general,â the ragged administrator of\n",
      "the blow exclaimed.\n",
      "\n",
      "âAnd it is not for you to be so gay,â Reilly returned, angrily, giving\n",
      "the blow back with added force.\n",
      "\n",
      "âHere, here!â broke in the first questioner. âFisticuffs under my very\n",
      "nose! No more of this, I command you both.â To Harry he added an extra\n",
      "caution: âYour zeal in my behalf will be better appreciated by being\n",
      "less demonstrative. Blows should be struck only on the battlefield.â To\n",
      "Reilly he said, with a slight smile hovering over his face, âMy name is\n",
      "Washington. Perhaps you may have heard of me?â\n",
      "\n",
      "To this Reilly replied: âI have, indeed, and heard you very well spoken\n",
      "of, too.â Emboldened by the otherâs smile, he ventured another question:\n",
      "âI think my reckoning of the day and year is badly at fault. An hour ago\n",
      "I thought the day was Christmas day. How far out of the way did my\n",
      "calculation take me, sir?â\n",
      "\n",
      "âThe day is indeed Christmas day, and the year is, as you must know, the\n",
      "year of our Lord one thousand seven hundred and seventy-seven.â\n",
      "\n",
      "Reilly again pinched himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "âWhy do you bring this man to me?â Washington now inquired, turning to\n",
      "Harry and his companions.\n",
      "\n",
      "âHe is a spy, sir,â said Harry.{246}\n",
      "\n",
      "âThat is a lie!â Reilly indignantly interpolated. âI have done nothing\n",
      "to warrant any such charge.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âWe found him in the Widow Robinâs house, pouring strong liquor down his\n",
      "throat.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âI had gone inside after information concerning the roads——â\n",
      "\n",
      "âWhich he was getting from a bottle, sir.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âIf drinking from a bottle of necessity constitutes being a spy, I fear\n",
      "our camp is already a hotbed,â Washington somewhat sagely remarked,\n",
      "casting his eye around slyly at his officers and men. âTell me,â he went\n",
      "on, with sudden sternness, looking Reilly through and through, as though\n",
      "to read his very thoughts, âis the charge true? Do you come from Howe?â\n",
      "\n",
      "âThe charge is not true, sir. I come from no one. I simply am making a\n",
      "tour of pleasure through this part of the country on my bicycle.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âWith the country swarming with the men from two hostile armies, any\n",
      "kind of a tour, save one of absolute necessity, seems ill-timed.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âWhen I set out I knew nothing about any armies. The fact is, sir——â\n",
      "Reilly started to make an explanation, but he checked himself on\n",
      "realizing that the telling of any such improbable yarn would only\n",
      "increase the hazardousness of his position.\n",
      "\n",
      "âWell?â Washington questioned, in a tone of growing suspicion.\n",
      "\n",
      "âI certainly did not know that your army or{247} any other army was\n",
      "quartered in this vicinity.â Reilly hesitated for lack of something\n",
      "further to say. âYou see,â he finally added, prompted by a happy idea,\n",
      "âI rode my wheel from New York.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âYou may have come from New York, though it is hard to believe you came\n",
      "on that singular-looking machine so great a distance. Where is the horse\n",
      "which drew the vehicle?â\n",
      "\n",
      "Reilly touched his bicycle. âThis is the horse, sir, just as it is; the\n",
      "vehicle,â he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "âThe man is crazy!â Harry exclaimed. Washington only looked the\n",
      "incredulity he felt, and this time asked a double question.\n",
      "\n",
      "âHow can the thing be balanced without it be held upright by a pair of\n",
      "shafts from a horseâs back, and how is the motive power acquired?â\n",
      "\n",
      "For an answer Reilly jumped upon the wheel, and at a considerable speed\n",
      "and in a haphazard way pedaled around the space within the hollow square\n",
      "of soldiers. Hither and thither he went, at one second nearly wheeling\n",
      "over the toes of the line of astonished, if not frightened, militiamen;\n",
      "at the next, bearing suddenly down on Harry and his companions and\n",
      "making them dance and jump about most alertly to avoid a collision. Even\n",
      "the dignified Washington was once or twice put to the necessity of\n",
      "dodging hurriedly aside when his equilibrium was threatened. Reilly\n",
      "eventually dismounted, doing so with assumed clumsiness by stopping the\n",
      "wheel at Harryâs back and falling over heavily against the soldier.{248}\n",
      "Harry tumbled to the ground, but Reilly dexterously landed on his feet.\n",
      "At once he began offering a profusion of apologies.\n",
      "\n",
      "âYou did that by design!â Harry shouted, jumping to his feet. His face\n",
      "was red with anger and he shook his fist threateningly at the bicyclist.\n",
      "\n",
      "Washington commanded the man to hold his peace. Then to Reilly he\n",
      "expressed a great surprise at his performance and a desire to know more\n",
      "about the bicycle. The young man thereupon described the machine\n",
      "minutely, lifting it into the air and spinning the wheels to illustrate\n",
      "how smoothly they rotated.\n",
      "\n",
      "âI can see it is possible to ride the contrivance with rapidity. It has\n",
      "been put together with wonderful ingenuity,â Washington said, when\n",
      "Reilly had replaced the wheel on the ground.\n",
      "\n",
      "âAnd you, sir, it is but a toy,â an officer spoke up. âPut our friend on\n",
      "his bundle of tin and race him against one of our horsemen and he would\n",
      "make a sorry showing.â\n",
      "\n",
      "Reilly smiled. âI bear the gentleman no ill-will for his opinion,â he\n",
      "said. âStill, I should like to show him by a practical test of the\n",
      "subject that his ignorance of it is most profound.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âYou would test the speed of the machine against that of a horse?â\n",
      "Washington said, in amazement.\n",
      "\n",
      "âI would, sir. You have a good road yonder.{249} With your permission and a\n",
      "worthy opponent I would make the test at once.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âBut, sir, the man is a spy,â Harry broke in. âWould it not be better to\n",
      "throw a rope around his neck and give him his deserts?â\n",
      "\n",
      "âThe charge is by no means proven,â Washington replied. âNor can it be\n",
      "until a court martial convenes this afternoon. And I see no reason why\n",
      "we may not in the meantime enjoy the unique contest which has been\n",
      "suggested. It will make a pleasant break in the routine of camp life.â\n",
      "\n",
      "A murmur of approval went up from the masses of men by whom they were\n",
      "surrounded. While they had been talking it seemed as though everybody in\n",
      "the camp not already on the scene had gathered together behind the\n",
      "square of infantry.\n",
      "\n",
      "âThen, sir,â Harry said, with some eagerness, âI would like to be the\n",
      "man to ride the horse. There is no better animal than mine anywhere. And\n",
      "I understand his tricks and humors quite well enough to put him to his\n",
      "best pace.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âI confess I have heard you well spoken of as a horseman,â Washington\n",
      "said. âBe away with you! Saddle and bridle your horse at once.â\n",
      "\n",
      "It was the chain of singular circumstances narrated above which brought\n",
      "John Reilly into the most remarkable contest of his life. He had entered\n",
      "many bicycle races at one time or other, always with credit to himself\n",
      "and to the club{250} whose colors he wore. And he had every expectation of\n",
      "making a good showing to-day. Yet a reflection of the weird conditions\n",
      "which had brought about the present contest took away some of his\n",
      "self-possession when a few minutes later he was marched over to the\n",
      "turnpike and left to his own thoughts, while the officers were pacing\n",
      "out a one mile straightaway course down the road.\n",
      "\n",
      "After the measurements had been taken, two unbroken lines of soldiers\n",
      "were formed along the entire mile; a most evident precaution against\n",
      "Reilly leaving the race course at any point to escape across the fields.\n",
      "Washington came up to him again, when the preparations were completed,\n",
      "to shake his hand and whisper a word or two of encouragement in his ear.\n",
      "Having performed these kindly acts he left to take up a position near\n",
      "the point of finish.\n",
      "\n",
      "The beginning of the course was located close to the battery of half\n",
      "concealed field pieces. Reilly was now conducted to this place. Shortly\n",
      "afterward Harry appeared on his horse. He leered at the bicyclist\n",
      "contemptuously and said something of a sarcastic nature partly under his\n",
      "breath when the two lined up, side by side, for the start. To these\n",
      "slights Reilly paid no heed; he had a strong belief that when the race\n",
      "was over there would be left in the mutton-like head of his opponent\n",
      "very little of his present inclination toward the humorous. The\n",
      "soldierâs mount{251} was a handsome black mare, fourteen and a half hands\n",
      "high; strong of limbs and at the flanks, and animated by a spirit that\n",
      "kept her prancing around with continuous action. It must be admitted\n",
      "that the man rode very well. He guided the animal with ease and\n",
      "nonchalance when she reared and plunged, and kept her movements confined\n",
      "to an incredibly small piece of ground, considering her abundance of\n",
      "action.\n",
      "\n",
      "âKeep to your own side of the road throughout the race. I donât want to\n",
      "be collided with by your big beast,â Reilly cautioned, while they were\n",
      "awaiting two signals from the starter.\n",
      "\n",
      "To this Harry replied in some derision, âIâll give you a good share of\n",
      "the road at the start, and all of it and my dust, too, afterward.â And\n",
      "then the officer who held the pistol fired the first shot.\n",
      "\n",
      "Reilly was well satisfied with the conditions under which the race was\n",
      "to be made. The road was wide and level, smooth, hard and straight, and\n",
      "a strong breeze which had sprung up, blew squarely against his back. His\n",
      "wheel was geared up to eighty-four inches; the breeze promised to be a\n",
      "valuable adjunct in pushing it along. Awaiting the second and last\n",
      "signal, Reilly glanced down the two blue ranks of soldiers, which\n",
      "stretched away into hazy lines in the distance and converged at the\n",
      "termination of the course where a flag had been stuck into the ground.\n",
      "The soldiers were at parade rest. Their unceasing{252} movements as they\n",
      "chatted to one another, turning their bodies this way and that and\n",
      "craning their heads forward to look toward the starting point, and then\n",
      "jerking them back, made the lines seem like long, squirming snakes. At\n",
      "the end of the course a thick bunch of militiamen clogged the road and\n",
      "overspread into the fields.\n",
      "\n",
      "Crack! The signal to be off. Reilly shoved aside the fellow who had been\n",
      "holding his wheel upright while astride of it, and pushed down on the\n",
      "pedals. The mareâs hoofs dug the earth; her great muscular legs\n",
      "straightened out; she sprang forward with a snort of apparent pleasure,\n",
      "taking the lead at the very start. Reilly heard the shout of excitement\n",
      "run along the two ranks of soldiers. He saw them waving their arms and\n",
      "hats as he went by. And on ahead through the cloud of dust there was\n",
      "visible the shadow-like outlines of the snorting, galloping horse, whose\n",
      "hoof beats sounded clear and sharp above the din which came from the\n",
      "sides of the highway. The mare crept farther and farther ahead. Very\n",
      "soon a hundred feet or more of the road lay between her and the\n",
      "bicyclist. Harry turned in his saddle and called out another sarcasm.\n",
      "\n",
      "âI shall pass you very soon. Keep to your own side of the road!â Reilly\n",
      "shouted, not a bit daunted by the way the race had commenced. His head\n",
      "was well down over the handle-bars, his back had the shape of the upper\n",
      "portion of an immense egg. Up and down his legs moved; faster and{253}\n",
      "faster and faster yet. He went by the soldiers so rapidly that they only\n",
      "appeared to be two streaks of blurry color. Their sharp rasping shouts\n",
      "sounded like the cracking of musketry. The cloud of dust blew against\n",
      "the bicyclistâs head and into his mouth and throat. When he glanced\n",
      "ahead again he saw with satisfaction that the mare was no longer\n",
      "increasing her lead. It soon became evident even that he was slowly\n",
      "cutting down the advantages she had secured.\n",
      "\n",

      "and lashed his animal furiously. Straining every nerve and sinew the\n",
      "mare for the moment pushed further ahead. Then her pace slackened a bit\n",
      "and Reilly again crept up to her. Closer and closer to her than before,\n",
      "until his head was abreast of her outstretched tail. Harry was lashing\n",
      "the mare and swearing at her unceasingly now. But she had spurted once\n",
      "and appeared to be incapable of again increasing her speed. In this way\n",
      "they went on for some little distance, Harry using his whip brutally,\n",
      "the mare desperately struggling to attain a greater pace, Reilly hanging\n",
      "on with tenacity to her hind flanks and giving up not an inch of ground.\n",
      "\n",
      "A mile is indeed a very short distance when traversed at such a pace.\n",
      "The finishing flag was{254} already but a few hundred feet further on.\n",
      "Reilly realized that it was time now to go to the front. He gritted his\n",
      "teeth together with determination and bent his head down even further\n",
      "toward his front wheel. Then his feet began to move so quickly that\n",
      "there was only visible an indistinct blur at the sides of his crank\n",
      "shaft. At this very second, with a face marked with rage and hatred,\n",
      "Harry brought his horse suddenly across the road to thet part of it\n",
      "which he had been warned to avoid.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is hard to tell what kept Reilly from being run into and trampled\n",
      "under foot. An attempt at back pedaling, a sudden twist of the\n",
      "handle-bar, a lurch to one side that almost threw him from his seat.\n",
      "Then, in the fraction of a second he was over on the other side of the\n",
      "road, pushing ahead of the mare almost as though she were standing\n",
      "still. The outburst of alarm from the throats of the soldiers changed\n",
      "when they saw that Reilly had not been injured; first into a shout of\n",
      "indignation at the dastardly attempt which had been made to run him\n",
      "down, and then into a roar of delight when the bicyclist breasted the\n",
      "flag a winner of the race by twenty feet.\n",
      "\n",
      "As he crossed the line Reilly caught a glimpse of Washington. He stood\n",
      "close to the flag and was waving his hat in the air with the enthusiasm\n",
      "of a schoolboy. Reilly went on down the road slackening his speed as\n",
      "effectively as he could. But before it was possible to entirely stop\n",
      "his{255} wheelâs momentum the noisy acclamations in his rear ceased with\n",
      "startling suddenness. He turned in his saddle and looked back. As sure\n",
      "as St. Peter he had the road entirely to himself. There wasnât a soldier\n",
      "or the ghost of a soldier in sight.\n",
      "\n",
      "As soon as he could he turned his bicycle about and rode slowly back\n",
      "along the highway, now so singularly deserted, looking hither and\n",
      "thither in vain for some trace of the vanished army. Even the flag which\n",
      "had been stuck into the ground at the end of the one-mile race course\n",
      "was gone. The breeze had died out again and the air was tranquil and\n",
      "warm. In the branches of a nearby tree two sparrows chirped and\n",
      "twittered peacefully. Reilly went back to the place where the camp had\n",
      "been. He found there only open fields on one side of the road and a\n",
      "clump of woodland on the other. He continued on down the little hill up\n",
      "which Harry and his companions had brought him a few hours previously\n",
      "and followed the road on further, coming finally to the fork in it near\n",
      "which was located the old farmhouse wherein he had been taken captive.\n",
      "The house was, as it had been when he had previously entered it, falling\n",
      "apart from age and neglect. When he went inside he found lying on the\n",

    "###### Conclusion of further research \n",
    "It is clear from the data which was gathered that the most frequent words in the chosen text, are not in facts words which necessarily evoke in the reader, the feeling of fear, dread or uneasiness. Many of the words are nouns such as *house*, *hand*, *room* etc. which in the contect of a horror setting may evoke the eerie feeling we  are expecting in a horror text. However, on their own, they have no such connotations. However, in this case, the word appearing most frequently in the text was the word *ghost*, which connects back to the title of the text."

In regards to horror stories,one can see that it is not necessarily the *scary words*, which build the atmosphere of a horror story, it may be the case of other aspect which together create such atmosphere. From the small text sample which we analysed with PoS, it is clear that the most frequent parts of speech used are verbs- and in turn adverbs. If we were to generalize and assume this would be the case for the whole text, the implications would be that the *essence* of what makes a horror story *scary* is its usage and description of actions.
